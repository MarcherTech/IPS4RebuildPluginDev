# IPS4 Rebuild Plugin Dev Tool
If you lost your plugin(s) development environment for any reason you can build another one with this script.

1. Ensure the plugin(s) you wish to rebuild development environments for are installed(with IN_DEV disabled) and enabled.
2. Upload rebuildPluginDev.php to your IPS4 root folder
3. Enable IN_DEV.
4. Run script via CLI.
5. The rename plugin directory/namespace tool will NOT remove the old directory, you need to do that manually.
