# IPS4 Rebuild Plugin Dev Tool
If you lost your plugin dev environment for any reason you can build another one with this script.
## How To Use
1. Upload rebuildPluginDev.php to your IPS4 root folder
2. Enable IN_DEV.
3. Run script via CLI.
## Notes
There are several options as there is quite the mess made upon normal install of a plugin.
Rebuilding the resources and versions requires the plugin xml uploaded or copied to the plugin folder.
The rename plugin directory/namespace tool will NOT remove the old directory, you need to do that manually.
